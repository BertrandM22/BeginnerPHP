# Getting started with PHP

So far, we've explored amazing areas of the web and built a ton of stuff.
Amazing things have been build up until now, but what if I told you there are multiple ways to do this? Especially when it comes to backend!

This brings us to the track to learn more ... BACK END Development ðŸ¥³.

I'll let you in on a couple of secrets:
1. [The centuries old markdown of PHP basics](./PHP-basics.md)
2. [Installation instructions](./PHP-installation.md)
3. [Best practices, according to... you](./PHP-best-practises.md)
4. I lied in 1, as PHP was released in 1995. Still, just pretend this guide was discovered just now by Indiana Jones.
