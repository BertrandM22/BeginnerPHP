## Tips
- **Do your research!!** Every exercise is build to be more than you know. so don't start blindly following the instructions. Research the topics and google best practices.

- After [Getting Started With PHP](./00.Getting-started-with-PHP/), try to find a a introductory tutorial on PHP you can follow. This will help understand the next exercises.

> **Note 01**: when watching or reading tutorials, focus on what you need, don't go down the rabbit hole as it is known to waste a lot of time.

> **Note 02**: Tutorials are also quickly giving the impression that you know what you need to know. **I recommend you still do every exercise in this training, even if it feels like you already understand the topic**!
