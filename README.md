This repository works as a template for the PHP course, Follow the course on our Moodle platform and find the templates in this repository under the same assignment names.

Keep in mind that the instructions to the assignments are not here but instead displayed in your Moodle virtual class environment.

## Tips
- **Read the assignments carefully!** a lot of information is given in the exercise descriptions/instructions. if you feel like you missed something, or things don't make sense anymore? Your first step should be to double check what the assignment says.

- **Reuse your design**. A lot of these assignments will be from scratch. As not to lose too much time on having to create a design for every exercise/project, I suggest you create one design and copy paste the css to each project. This way you will save a lot of time that can now be spend on working on the logic!

- **Do your research!!** Every exercise is build to introduce more than you know. so don't start blindly following the instructions. Research the topics and google best practices.

- **Use the community/web**. Write stackoverflow questions, join discord php/dev communities, etc... One thing you will need to get used to, is being able to go online and ask for help if you are stuck. This is a crucial skill for anyone that wants to find work in development.

- After being introduced to the [PHP-Basics](./01.PHP-Basics/), try to find a a introductory tutorial on PHP you can follow. This will help you to understand the following exercises better.

> **Note 01**: when watching or reading tutorials, focus on what you need, don't go down the rabbit hole as it is known to waste a lot of time.

> **Note 02**: Tutorials are also quickly giving the impression that you know what you need to know. **I recommend you still do every exercise in this training, even if it feels like you already understand the topic**!

Good luck!
